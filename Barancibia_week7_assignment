Week 7 Assignment

1) Create a new database.

CREATE DATABASE honduras;

2) Populate your newly created database with two tables that have a one-to-many relationship. 
You should create the two tables using the CREATE TABLE command. 
There should be at least one example each of integer, numeric, character, and a date data type in at least one of the two tables. 
There should be at least one character column that allows NULLs. Deliverable: Your two CREATE TABLE statements.

create table project(
project_id varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
project_name varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
donor varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
recipient varchar(100)  NOT NULL,
amount int,
PRIMARY KEY(project_id)
);

create table project_info(
project_id varchar(100) NOT NULL,
project_active boolean NOT NULL,
recipient varchar(100) NOT NULL,
implementing_agency varchar(100) NOT NULL,
project_start DATE NOT NULL,
project_end DATE NOT NULL,
notes varchar(260),
PRIMARY KEY(recipient),
FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES project(project_id)
);

3) Populate the two tables with some sample data, using INSERT statements. 
Each table should contain at least three records, and the data should accurately reflect the one-to-many relationship. 
There should also be at least one row where the character column that allows NULL values has a value of NULL. 
Deliverable: your set of INSERT statements.

INSERT into project(project_id, project_name, donor, recipient, amount) values('H123', 'Water Purification Project in Teguz', 'USAID', 'Honduras', 10000000);

INSERT into project_info(project_id, project_active, recipient, implementing_agency, project_start, project_end, notes) values('H123', TRUE, 'Honduras', 'AKVO', '2014-03-21', '2016-5-10', NULL);

4)Provide samples of the different kinds of joins across the two tables. 
You should include one join that performs a WHERE on the COLUMN that allows a NULL value. 
Deliverable: Your SELECT statements.

SELECT*FROM project;

SELECT*FROM project_info;

--INNER JOIN--

SELECT*from project a INNER JOIN project_info b ON a.project_id = b.project_id;



SELECT*
FROM project_info
WHERE notes='NULL';
