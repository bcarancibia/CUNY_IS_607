__**Background**__

This is report is the MSDA 607 - Data Acquistion and Management Final Project. As detailed in the project proposal three different datasets will be used to look at financial foreign aid in Honduras. The three datasets are Honduras foreign aid commitments, Honduras financial foreign aid project's locations, and an indicator level dataset with various types of data. This project will be broken into five sections as follows: 1) Introduction and Workflow, 2) Obtaining the Data, 3) Data Transformation, 4) Statistical Analysis and Visualization, 5) Conclusion. Most of the data was collected via the Aid Management Platform (AMP) which my company builds for developing countries to record their foreign aid. This project is important and has real world applications because the results will be used to continue my company's transition from data collectors towards data analysis. 

__**Introduction and Workflow**__

This project is using three different datasets created by different organizations. The Honduras Foreign Aid Commitments was entered into the AMP by the Government of Honduras (GoH), the AMP data is stored in a PostGres Database. The locations data for each project was obtained from the Donors that fund projects in Honduras. This location data is not shared with the GoH and is one of the many pitfalls of the international development sector. The indicator level dataset which has data from the municipalities of Honduras including population density and number of Hospitals per municipality was created by a GoH Ministry called El Sistema Nacional de Informaci√≥n Territorial which has been since dissolved because of elections last year.

The data science workflow of this project will follow a typical OSEMN workflow, which can be seen below.

This workflow will be used during this analysis.


__**Obtain the Data**__

The data was obtained from three different sources. The Honduras Foreign Aid Projects are located in a Postgres Database. Unfortunately do to security reasons this report cannot have a direct query to the database, but the query used can be shown and how a user would connect to PostGreSQL Database from R if desired (for this project the command line was used).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sqldf)

library(RPostgreSQL)
 
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
db <- dbConnect(drv, dbname="Honduras",
                 user="username", password="password")


sqldf("SELECT * 
      FROM 
      view_todos_proyectos") # view for all projects in the database

sqldf("COPY (SELECT * 
      FROM view_todos_proyectos) 
      TO '/users/bcarancibia/CUNY_IS_607/Final_Project' 
      USING DELIMITERS ',' WITH  CSV") # copy for all projects in the database

```

I exported the data using a view because there are about ~150 tables in the database with different data, it is just easier to select the view and export. To get the view a user would need to query and join about 45 tables to get all the different variables shown in an entire db export, this is something currently being streamlined during a reengineering process. This data is completely open and can be downloaded form the Honduras AMP website www.pgc.sre.gob.hn.

The other two datasets were downloaded in CSV format. The locations data is downloaded from the GoH AMP Website (www.pgc.sre.gob.hn). The SINIT dataset which is the indicator dataset was downloaded from Development Gateway's internal repository of data Wiki.

The three datasets are then imported into R.

```{r}


honduras_indicator = read.csv("/users/bcarancibia/CUNY_IS_607/Final_Project/indicator_honduras.csv", 
                    header = TRUE)

honduras_projects = read.csv("/users/bcarancibia/CUNY_IS_607/Final_Project/commitments_honduras.csv", 
                    header = TRUE)

honduras_locations = read.csv("/users/bcarancibia/CUNY_IS_607/Final_Project/locations_honduras.csv", 
                    header = TRUE)



```

Always good to take a look at the data after import to make sure everything went well.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
head(honduras_indicator) #indicator

head(honduras_projects) #project commitments

head(honduras_locations) #locations of projects

```

After performing this there are about 15 pages of data to be shown which is a lot for three datasets and this size is not the focus of this report. It also means there is a lot of data that can be scrubbed and trimmed down.

__**Data Transformation**__

Now that the data has been imported a couple data transformations need to be done. The projects and locations need to be joined by the ID known as AMPID in projects and Codigo PGC in the locations table. After joining these two files together a new file will be created with just the columns needed to do analysis. This new file will then be joined with indicator data by municipality.
