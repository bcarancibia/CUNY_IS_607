Week 13 Quiz

Question 1

I chose to do a comparison of R and Julia. Using information on the R microbenchmark website (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Performance.html) I created a function to calculate standard deviation from 1000 elements from a uniform distribution.

run  <- function() {
    ssize <- 10000
    nboot <- 1000
    x <- runif(ssize)
    y <- replicate(nboot, sd(sample(x, ssize, TRUE)))
    sd(y)
}

for (i in 1:4) {
    cat(system.time(run())[3], " ")
}


The results of the R function are below:

Results: 0.293  0.28  0.271  0.269  


The same comparisons were performed in Julia.

function run()
    ssize = 10000
    nboot = 1000
    x = rand(ssize)
    y = Array(Float64,nboot)
    bx = Array(Float64, ssize)
    for i in 1:nboot
        for j in 1:ssize
            bx[j] = x[(rand(Uint32) % ssize) + 1]
        end
        y[i] = std(bx)
    end
    std(y)
end

for i in 1:4
    print("$(@elapsed run())  ")
end

The results of the Julia function are below:

julia> Julia_perfomance
0.058468239  0.056899262  0.061884639  0.056630974  


The results show that Julia was significantly faster than R in the standard deviation calculation above. Julia took about 0.05 seconds while R took 0.293 seconds. The result could be a bit skewed because the julia code is devectorized, if the Julia code was written a bit different then the Julia time needed could be higher.


Questions 2

Create a stored procedure that inserts or updates a table.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
    upsert_description(thename text, thedescription text)
RETURNS INT
AS $$

    DECLARE theid INT;
    BEGIN
	    SELECT  ID FROM ObjectList WHERE name = theName INTO theid LIMIT 1;
	    IF theid IS NOT NULL THEN
	         UPDATE ObjectList SET description = theDescription WHERE ID = theid;
	    ELSE
		INSERT INTO ObjectList (coffee_name, coffee_description) 
VALUES (thename, thedescription) RETURNING id INTO theid;
	    END IF;

	    RETURN theid;
    END;
    $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;


CREATE TABLE ObjectList
(
	id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	coffee_name VARCHAR(64),
	coffee_description VARCHAR(256)
);


SELECT upsert_description('Espresso', 'Espressos keep developers going in the morning. There are never enough of them.');
SELECT upsert_description('Cappuccino', 'For the finer moments. Wrap your espresso in a tasty layer of foam.');
SELECT upsert_description('Mocha', 'Chocolate.');
SELECT upsert_description('Latte', 'If you are more into milk than into foam.');

SELECT * FROM ObjectList
