__**Project 5**__

I found a really interesting R package on Github that allows you to easily interact with a Neo4j graph database from the R environment. This package is called RNeo4j.

```{r}
require(RNeo4j)
```

Load the R data and instalize the graph
```{r}
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")
importSample(graph, "tweets")
```

Take a look at Neo4j's Tweets.

```{r}
neo4j = getUniqueNode(graph, "User", screen_name = "neo4j")
sapply(lapply(outgoingRels(neo4j, "POSTS"), endNode), function(t) t$text)
```


Show the Top mentioned users in the Nwo4j tweets using a Cypher Query.
```{r}
query = "
MATCH (:Tweet)-[:MENTIONS]->(u:User)
RETURN u.screen_name AS user, COUNT(*) AS mentions
ORDER BY mentions DESC
LIMIT 10
"

cypher(graph, query)
```
